# Dijkstra-Algorithm-with-variable-edge-cost
A program can calculate OSPF with variable edge cost and consider edge loading

### How to compile 
If you are using UNIX/Linux environment, you can use our makefile to compile code easily.

```bash
make
```

If you want to clean the object files and executable files, you can just type:

```bash
make clean
```

then makefile will delete object files and executable files for you.

### How to use this program
After compiling, you can get a executable files named as ```DJ_Algorithm_EXE```, you can run it like this:
```bash
./DJ_Algorithm_EXE
```
First of all, our program will guide you to build up your topology. 
After building topology, program will ask you enter routing information such as start node and end node.
